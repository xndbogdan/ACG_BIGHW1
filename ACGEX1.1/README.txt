BIG HOMEWORK EX 1

Petrache Mircea & Mosteanu Bogdan

CONTROLS:

1 - Don't draw anything
2 - Draw square at random position
3 - Draw triangle at random position
4 - Draw circle at random position

Up Arrow Key    - Move camera forward
Down Arrow Key  - Move camera backwards
Left Arrow Key  - Move camera to the left
Right Arrow Key - Move camera to the right
W Key           - Move camera up
S Key           - Move camera down

Issues:
- Circle drawing doesn't work when using the shape switching code, but works if you draw from scratch, in a new window.
Since that would be a workaround at best, we decided not to implement it, and just straight up draw what we can on the screen.
